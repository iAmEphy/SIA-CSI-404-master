# SIA-CSI-404
Assembly language created in C
SIA is the Assembler source code
siavm is the virtual machine

For assembler.c, arguments passed are two text files, an input of assembly code, and output Binary text file (ascii hex dump if read in hex reader) 

run as:
e.g. run assembler.c input.txt output.txt
for vm, it just accepts one argument , the output from the assembler

12/7/2019 The VM has been updated to include very rough simulated pipelining (not actual pipelining)



Side notes:
SIA404 and SIA are both directorys to the assembler
USE SIA: this is the up to date directory

SIAVM vs siavm (former is from desktop, latter is from laptop)
